## Project Structure

The repository is organized as a monorepo with two main directories:

*   `Blogging website frontend/`: Contains the complete React front-end application built with Vite.
*   `server/`: Contains the Node.js/Express back-end server, including API routes and Mongoose schemas.

## Setup and Installation

To get QuickTale running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   npm
*   MongoDB instance (local or cloud)

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the server directory:**
    ```sh
    cd server
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `server` directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```env
    DB_LOCATION=your_mongodb_connection_string
    PORT=3000
    SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_access_key
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
    ```
4.  **Set up Firebase Admin:**
    *   Generate a service account key JSON file from your Firebase project console.
    *   Rename the file to `quicktale-2d287-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-1240e5de82.json` and place it in the `server` directory.

5.  **Run the server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will start on the port specified in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd "Blogging website frontend"
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the frontend directory and add your backend server's URL:
    ```env
    VITE_SERVER_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000
    ```
4.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## API Endpoints

The backend server exposes the following REST API endpoints:
